this folder (`icons/icon-metadata`) intended to store generated metatdata info
from scrips in `../tasks/`

will refactor as we work!

## steps to building icon sketch pacakge:

_(paths written from root `icons` folder)_

- add icon to `categories.yml`
- run `node tasks/output-icon-category-mapping.js`.
  - this generates the category json info
- run `node tasks/scaffold-metadata.yml` from package root
  - this updates `metadata.yml` with updated category information
- edit `icons/metadata.yml` to add/edit additional information
- run `node tasks/output-metadata-json.js`
  - this generates `icon-metadata.json`, which is used in the sketch plugin

todo: create a script/command to run all these in sequence? combine them into a
single build script? separate this info, or at least the authoring scripts &
info, into an `icons-metadata` package?

thoughts:

- `categories.yml`

  - manually authored
  - currently kept this at root because it is manually authored

- `metadata.yml`

  - partly manually authored, also updated via `scaffold-metadata.js`
  - currently kept this at root because it is manually edited

- `metadata.json`

  - currently, just the json stringified version of `metadata.yml`

- `icon-category-mapping.json`

  - currently generated by `output-icon-category-mapping.js`
  - pulls info from `categories.yml`

- `meta.json` - more accurately would be renamed to something like
  `build-info.json`
