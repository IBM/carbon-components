# Component specification anatomy

A draft for how we could standardize our written component specifications that
eventually get built as component README.md's and consumed in Carbon website.

## Guidance

When evaluating this component, I want to understand the design pattern so I can
determine if this component can help me provide the desired user experience.

- References (links to W3C WAI-ARIA)
- When/why to use
- Visuals (no redlines)

## Implementation

When building this component, I want to reference the canonical implementation's
structure and behavior so I can match it, thus inherit visuals, user experience
and accessibility efforts.

- Reference implementation (link to Storybook, or embed in website)
- Rule 1 description (link to rule)
- Rule 2 description (link to rule)
- Rule 3 description (link to rule)

## Theming

When using this component in my application, I want to know what can be
customized and how to customize it, so I can use it in a future-friendly way.

- Token table

## Tests

When designing, building or using this component, I want to know its history and
what contributed to its current state, so future efforts don't cause regression
of any kind.

- A11y grade
- A11y manual tests (timestamped with findings)
- Usability manual tests (timestamped with findings)
