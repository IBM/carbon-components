## Overview

Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They
communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages
in a variety of ways. `Button` labels express what action will occur when the
user interacts with it.

  <Story id="button--default" />
</Preview>

## Icon-only Buttons

Icon buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.
Icon buttons can take the form of any of the five types (Primary, Secondary,
Tertiary, Danger and Ghost) but most commonly will be styled as primary or ghost
buttons.

  <Story id="button--icon-button" />

## Set of Buttons

When an action required by the user has more than one option, always use a a
negative action `Button` (secondary) paired with a positive action `Button`
(primary) in that order. Negative action buttons will be on the left. Positive
action buttons should be on the right. When these two types buttons are paired
in the correct order, they will automatically space themselves apart.

## Skeleton state

You can use the `ButtonSkeleton` component to render a skeleton variant of a
button. This is useful to display on initial page load to indicate tousers that
content is being loaded.

<Preview>
  <Story id="button--skeleton" />
</Preview>

## Component API

<Props sort="asc" />

Additional props passed into `Button` will be forwarded along to the underlying
button element.

### Button `as`

This prop allows you to specify a different element to be rendered as a
`Button`.

```jsx
<Button as="a" href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/">
  Navigate
</Button>
```

### Button `className`

The className prop passed into `Button` will be forwarded along to the
underlying `Button` element. This is useful for specifying a custom class name
for layout.

```jsx
<Button className="custom-class">Submit</Button>
```

### Button `size`

This prop specifies which size the `Button` should be rendered at. Valid values
are `field`, `small`, and `default`. If no `size` is specified, it renders as
`default`.

<Button>Submit</Button> <Button size="field">Submit</Button> <Button size="small">
  Submit
</Button>

```jsx
<Button>Submit</Button>
<Button size="field">Submit</Button>
<Button size="small">Submit</Button>
```
