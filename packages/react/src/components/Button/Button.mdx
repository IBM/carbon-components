## Overview

Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They
communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages
in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user
interacts with it.

## Icon-only Buttons

Icon buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.
Icon buttons can take the form of any of the five types (Primary, Secondary,
Tertiary, Danger and Ghost) but most commonly will be styled as primary or ghost
buttons.

## Set of Buttons

When an action required by the user has more than one option, always use a a
negative action button (secondary) paired with a positive action button
(primary) in that order. Negative action buttons will be on the left. Positive
action buttons should be on the right. When these two types buttons are paired
in the correct order, they will automatically space themselves apart.

## Skeleton state

<!--
Each use-case of this component becomes its own section. For example,
if an accordion had a skeleton then you would name this section Skeleton.

If the component had a specific piece of functionality or behavior, like
how you can sort with a Data Table, then Sorting would be the name of this
section.

This section should include an explainer for the use-case and when to use it,
along with a code snippet that someone could bring into their project.
-->

You can use the `ButtonSkeleton` component to render a skeleton variant of a
button. This is useful to display on initial page load to indicate tousers that
content is being loaded.
