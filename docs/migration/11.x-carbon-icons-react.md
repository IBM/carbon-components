# `@carbon/icons-react`

**Note: everything in this file is a work-in-progress and will be changed.**

## Overview

The `@carbon/icons-react` package has been updated to minimize the number of
exports from the package to help reduce build and compile times.

At the time of migration, the project was using roughly 1,600 SVG assets to
generate 6,400 JavaScript exports. The changes described below brought this
number down to roughly 1,600 exports. In other words, each SVG asset from our
icon library will have one JavaScript export in this package.

To accomplish this, we updated the components to accept a `size` prop instead of
tying in the size to the name of the component itself.

**Before**

```jsx
import { Add32, Add24, Add20, Add16 } from '@carbon/icons-react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Add32 />
      <Add24 />
      <Add20 />
      <Add16 />
    </>
  );
}
```

**After**

```jsx
import { Add } from '@carbon/icons-react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Add />
      <Add size={24} />
      <Add size={20} />
      <Add size={16} />
    </>
  );
}
```

By default, the `size` prop will point to the 32px x 32px SVG asset for the
icon.

All other props normally provided to these icons have not changed and will
continue to work as-expected.

### Migration

Manual

- If you use the name `ForwardRef(IconName16)` in a test you will need to
  manually change this. Prefer to use the component directly if using enzyme
- If you use snapshot tests, the structure will change and include a `size`
  prop. Make sure that the `size` prop value matches what your icon name used to
  be. For example, `<Add16 />` should become `<Add size={16} />`
