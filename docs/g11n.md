# Notes of globalization

* `carbon-components` let you define most of the markups, where most of the translatable contents are in. Application needs to make sure such contents in the markups are translatable as needed.
* Also, from the same reason above, application needs to make sure list items in the markup are in the correct order.
* Date picker component relies on the G11N features in [`Flatpickr` library]((https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/)). See [here](../src/components/date-picker/README.md#localization) for more details.
* Some styles in our Sass code have directives of [RTLCSS library](https://rtlcss.com/learn/usage-guide/control-directives/index.html).
