## Overview

Date pickers allow users to select a single or a range of dates. Pickers are
used to display past, present, or future dates. The kind of date (exact,
approximate, memorable) you are requesting from the user will determine which
picker is best to use. Each picker’s format can be customized depending on
location or need.

### Simple DatePicker

The simple date input provides the user with only a text field in which they can
manually input a date. It allows dates to be entered without adding unnecessary
interactions that come with the calendar menu or a dropdown.

<Preview>
  <Story id="datepicker--simple" />
</Preview>

### Range Datepicker

Calendar pickers default to showing today’s date when opened and only one month
is shown at a time. Calendar pickers allow users to navigate through months and
years, however they work best when used for recent or near future dates.

<Preview>
  <Story id="datepicker--single" />
  <Story id="datepicker--range" />
</Preview>

### Skeleton state

You can use the `DatePickerSkeleton` component to render a skeleton variant of a
`DatePicker`. This is useful to display while an initial date range in your
`DatePicker` is being fetched from an external resource like an API.

<Preview>
  <Story id="datepicker--skeleton" />
</Preview>

## Component API

<Props />

### DatePicker `className`

The className prop passed into `DatePicker` will be forwarded along to the
underlying wrapper `div.bx--content-switcher` element. This is useful for
specifying a custom class name for layout.

```jsx
<DatePicker className="some-class">...</DatePicker>
```
