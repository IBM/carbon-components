# `v10.6.3` and `v10.6.4` broken patch release

**Summary**

Different new feature related PRs were making their way into the patch release
PR. These releases were done manually, as well, but there was no way of knowing
when PRs were tied to a new feature. `v10.6.3` was released under `next` after
successfully opening a PR for it, with ci passing build. It wasn't until testing
`next` that we realized it was actually broken because of a new token. We
immediately cut `v10.6.4` to fix it, and cherry-picked the PRs manually again.
We ended up having to re-do this process 4 times because each time, different
PRs were being tied to a new feature. The commit titles are not enough for an
endgame developer to know that the fixes are feat related. When `v10.6.4` was
finally published under next, everything was working as expected. However, when
updating to latest our packages were broken for a while since the endgame doc
script was not correct.

**Impact**

The impact of this is that it is time consuming for the endgame developer, who
has regular project work to do on top of endgame work. All in all, it took a
whole day just to release a patch. The other impact is that our users can run
into issues installing our packages.

**Root causes**:

The main reason for this problem is that there is no current convention to
specify that a `chore`, `refactor`, `docs` or `fix` PR is related to a `feat`
PR. The other root cause of one of the problems comes from incorrect docs, which
meant the script we ran to update `latest` was wrong.

**Detection**

We discovered that new features were included in the patch by testing our `next`
tag and realizing it was broken, or seeing the ci build fail in the patch
release PRs. We discovered that the `latest` tag was then broken through a user
who posted a message on slack saying he couldn't add our package as a
dependency.

**Resolution**

We addressed the new features in the patch by releasing a new patch that
excluded the original PR that was breaking the patch. This new patch however had
to be re-released 4 times because each time it was discovered that a different
PR had a new feature. Since we hadn't published to `next` the resolution was
just to keep re-releasing and opening a PR until we saw that the ci build was
passing, which meant there were no new features.

We addressed the broken `latest` tag by running the correct script to update the
tag.
