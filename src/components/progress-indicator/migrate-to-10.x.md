### HTML

We have introduced following new features:

- "Optional" label
- Tooltip for overflowed content

Those new features require the corresponding markup. Also icon from [`carbon-elements`](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-elements) package is now used. Vanilla markup should be migrated to one shown in [carbondesignsystem.com](https://next.carbondesignsystem.com/components/progress-indicator/code) site. React and other framework variants should reflect the change automatically.
