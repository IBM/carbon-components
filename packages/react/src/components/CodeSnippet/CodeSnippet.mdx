## Overview

Code snippets are strings or small blocks of reusable code that are copyable. We
don't provide the copy functionality and recommend
[clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/).

## Inline

Inline code snippet's are used for distinguishing a symbol, variable, function
name or similar small piece of code from it's surrounding text.

## Multi

Multiple line code snippets are used for displaying code with more than one
line. They're shown in a block and useful for showing classes, functions, blocks
of styles and the like. There is an option to wrap the lines displayed if the
lines are longer than the container.

## Single

Single line code snippets are used when showing code that fits on one line
without wrapping. Useful for calling out terminal commands, function
invocations, expressions etc.

## Skeleton

You can use the `CodeSnippetSkeleton` component to render a skeleton variant of
an code snippet. This is useful to display while content in your code snippet is
being fetched from an external resource like an API.
