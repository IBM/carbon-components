# Carbon Contribution Model

Carbon Design System is an **open source** project at IBM. We pride ourselves in
open and inclusive design and development. If you're wondering more about our
contribution process, you're in the right place. First off, thank you for your
interest! This project is made possible not only by the core Carbon team, but
also by several community members who have invested their own time to give back
to the Carbon community.

## Code of Conduct

We value all of our community members, and thus want to foster a positive
contributing environment. Please take a look at our
[code of conduct](./code_of_conduct.md) before engaging in our workspaces.

## Overview

#### Who can contribute?

Anyone! We mean it.

- **Development:** If coding is your thing, you can help us by contributing bug
  fixes or community components. Checkout our
  [Developer Handbook](../developer-handbook.md) to get your dev environment set
  up, read up on our best practices and more.
- **Design:** Design contributions can vary from visual assets, UX interactions,
  motion design, Sketch kit bug fixes and more.
- **Content:** Our documentation is just as important as our design and code
  assets. Whether it's updating our current docs, or adding new patterns, anyone
  can contribute to our
  [website content](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website).
- **Research:** Carbon is made up of developers and designers, but
  unfortunately, no dedicated researchers. If you're a researcher and have
  findings that you think could improve Carbon users' experience, you're in the
  right place. This kind of contribution is most effective if coupled with
  design and development forces.

#### Besides some of the obvious contributions mentioned above, how else can I contribute?

Great question! Contribution does require creating or maintaining our assets.
Here are some other ways you can contribute, which don't require much work:

- **Join our slack community and interact with other users.** We have hundreds
  of users world wide, and quite a small team in comparison. While we try our
  best to answer questions on slack, it's not always possible to answer
  everything. One of the easiest ways to help us it to jump in on slack
  conversations if there's something you know the answer to! Some of our most
  popular slack channels include `#carbon-components`, `#carbon-react`,
  `#carbon-design-system`.
- **Report bugs.** Even if you don't have the time to contribute a bug fix,
  opening an issue alone makes a big difference! Be sure to completely fill out
  the issue template to best help us understand what is going wrong.
