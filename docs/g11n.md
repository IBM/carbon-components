# Notes of globalization

* `carbon-components` lets you define most of the markup, which contains most of the translatable content. Ensure application content in the markup is translatable as needed.
* Also, from the same reason above, application needs to make sure list items in the markup are in the correct order.
* Date picker component relies on the G11N features in [`Flatpickr` library]((https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/)). See [here](../src/components/date-picker/README.md#localization) for more details.
* Some styles in our Sass code have directives of [RTLCSS library](https://rtlcss.com/learn/usage-guide/control-directives/index.html).
