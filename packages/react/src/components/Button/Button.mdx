## Overview

<!--
This should include the default use-case(s) for a component, at most 2.
This should be the most common way the component is used.
It should summarize what this common is for and provide snippets for how
to accomplish these common use-cases

## Icon-only Buttons

## Set of Buttons

## Skeleton state

<!--
Each use-case of this component becomes its own section. For example,
if an accordion had a skeleton then you would name this section Skeleton.

If the component had a specific piece of functionality or behavior, like
how you can sort with a Data Table, then Sorting would be the name of this
section.

This section should include an explainer for the use-case and when to use it,
along with a code snippet that someone could bring into their project.
-->

You can use the `ButtonSkeleton` component to render a skeleton variant of a
button. This is useful to display on initial page load to indicate tousers that
content is being loaded.
