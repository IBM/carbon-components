this folder intended to store generated metatdata info from scrips in
`../tasks/`

will refactor as we work!

thoughts:

- `categories.yml`

  - manually authored
  - currently kept this at root because it is manually authored

- `metadata.yml`

  - partly manually authored, also updated via `scaffold-metadata.js`
  - currently kept this at root because it is manually edited

- `metadata.json`

  - currently, just the json stringified version of `metadata.yml`

- `icon-category-mapping.json`

  - currently generated by `output-icon-category-mapping.js`
  - pulls info from `categories.yml`

- `meta.json` - more accurately would be renamed to something like
  `build-info.json`
