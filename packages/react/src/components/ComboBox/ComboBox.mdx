## Overview

A combobox allows the user to make a selection from a predefined list of options
and is typically used when there are a large amount of options to choose from.

<Preview>
  <Story id="combobox--combobox" />
</Preview>

## Disabled

A disabled comobobox is available but should not be used as the sole means of
conveying information. For example, if the user must complete a previous form
input before moving on to the combobox, make sure to make that clear to the user
via an error state on the previous form element in adition to disabling the next
element.

<Preview>
  <Story id="combobox--disabled" />
</Preview>

## Light

The light prop should never be used against a light background. The form element
must have proper contrast against the pages background.

## Combobox `downshiftProps`

Our `Combobox` component utilizes [Downshift](https://www.downshift-js.com/)
under the hood to help provide complex yet accessible custom dropdown
components. We provide access to the built in Downshift features with this prop.
For more information, checkout the Downshift prop
[documentation](https://www.downshift-js.com/downshift#props-used-in-examples)

## Placeholders and Labeling

The placeholder is not a replacement for a label under any circumstances
including space restraints. Placeholders should be used to provide additive
information regarding the format of the input. In all cases a label is required
_in addition to_ a placeholder.

## Component API

<Props sort="asc" />
