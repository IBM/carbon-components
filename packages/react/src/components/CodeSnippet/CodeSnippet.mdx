# CodeSnippet

## Overview
Code snippets are strings or small blocks of reusable code that can be copied and inserted in a code file.

There are three different types of code snippets to help cater to varied line length use casesâ€”inline, single line, and multi-line.

## Inline
A block of text used inline with setences or paragraphs

## Single line
